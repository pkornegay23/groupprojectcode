Final project code
This final project was created by Natalie Hochhaus, Eleanor Gagnon, and Patrick Kornegay, Jr.

This “choose your own adventure” will be a game that allows a user to choose whatever direction they want in this scenario of finding a stolen jewel. Each choice the user makes will push them forward to complete the game, cause them to turn around, die and/or start over. The user is first prompted to choose between going after a mage, relative, or ambassador.

To write this program we will primarily be creating multiple functions for each scenario and choice that can be called when needed. Each function consists of "if" statements that call other functions depending on the user's choice. If the user types in an incorrect word, they are prompted to retype their answer. There are a few functions (death, start, and intro) that can be called multiple times in the three paths. The mage and relative paths connect to the amabassador path in the town (see tree map for further details). There are no programs that need to be downloaded to play the game.

Natalie wrote the mage path, intro scene, start function, and the death function. Eleanor wrote the ambassador path, successfunction1, and successfunction2. Patrick wrote the relative path.
